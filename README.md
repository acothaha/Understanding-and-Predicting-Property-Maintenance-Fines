# Understanding and Predicting Property Maintenance Fines
#### Understanding when and why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket.

### This is my first 'Proper' notebook of a classification prediction model that i completed for a Coursera course final assignment in 2020 in Bandung, Indonesia.

This notebook is well-organized and comprehensive. it was the last assignment that i have to complete for the "Applied Machine Learning with Python" course from Coursera.
I am really pleased with how I build this model and I am satisfied about the result.
